# Wireshark-Lab-Assignment---Network-Protocol-Analysis
üì° Wireshark Lab Assignment - Network Protocol Analysis
This repository contains my lab work for the Wireshark Protocol Analysis assignment, completed as part of my computer networking coursework. The primary objective of this lab is to deepen understanding of network protocols by capturing and analyzing live packet data using Wireshark, a powerful and widely-used network protocol analyzer.

üîç Objective
The goal of this lab is to:

Gain hands-on experience with packet sniffing and protocol dissection

Explore the behavior of fundamental protocols like HTTP, TCP, UDP, DNS, ICMP, and ARP

Learn to trace connection setups and teardowns (e.g., TCP 3-way handshake)

Analyze packet structure, flags, payloads, and headers

Investigate common issues and performance indicators in network communication

üõ† Tools & Setup
Wireshark (latest stable version)

Internet connection for real-time traffic capture

Filter expressions for protocol-focused analysis

üìÇ Contents
capture_files/: PCAP files from the lab session

screenshots/: Annotated screenshots showing captured packet analysis

lab_report.pdf: Formal report including:

Protocol-specific analysis (HTTP, TCP, DNS, etc.)

Key findings and observations

README.md: Overview of the lab and learning outcomes

üß† Key Learning Outcomes
Effectively apply Wireshark filters to isolate specific traffic

Interpret packet-level data to understand protocol operations

Identify anomalies and potential issues in packet flows

Build confidence in using Wireshark as a diagnostic and educational tool
