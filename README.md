# 📡 Wireshark Lab Assignment - Network Protocol Analysis

This repository contains my lab work for the **Wireshark Protocol Analysis** assignment, completed as part of my computer networking coursework. The primary objective of this lab is to deepen understanding of network protocols by capturing and analyzing live packet data using **Wireshark**, a powerful and widely-used network protocol analyzer.

## 🔍 Objective

The goal of this lab is to:

- Gain hands-on experience with **packet sniffing** and **protocol dissection**
- Explore the behavior of fundamental protocols like **HTTP, TCP, UDP, DNS, ICMP, and ARP**
- Learn to trace connection setups and teardowns (e.g., TCP 3-way handshake)
- Analyze packet structure, flags, payloads, and headers
- Investigate common issues and performance indicators in network communication

---

## 🛠 Tools & Setup

- **Wireshark** (latest stable version)
- Internet connection for real-time traffic capture
- Custom **Wireshark display filters** for protocol-specific analysis
